# Guessing Game 2.0

An analysis of the Guessing Game shows that the AI selecting the computer_choice in the guessing game is not very good.

The problem is that the current version of the game always chooses 2 as the computer_choice.

Task:
- Modify the guessing game so that the computer_choice is random

Task:
- Count how many attempts is takes for the user to win the game
- Upon winning, print a message telling the user how many attempts it took them
