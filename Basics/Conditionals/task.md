# If Statement 

```if``` is the conditional statement in Python.

An if statement begins with the word if, followed by an expression that evaluates to
```True``` or ```False``` (Boolean expression), followed by a colon (:), then a series of idented statements that are executed if the expression is True. 

Note: Unlike Java, you do not need to surround the condition within parenthesis()

The names True and False are constants having the obvious meaning, and a variable that can take on these values is a logical or Boolean variable. 

## Boolean Expression
The Boolean expression in Python can be anything that has a result that is ```True``` or ```False```. It can be any of the following:
- A constant like ```True``` or ```False```
- A logical expression (one that compares two things)
- A logical combination of the previously listed options
- A variable that has a True or False value. Commonly referred to as a flag

# Logical Expressions in Python
A logical expression can be any arithmetic expressions being compared using any of the following operators:
- ```<``` Less than
- ```>``` Greater than
- ```<=``` Less than or equal to
- ```>=``` Greater than or equal to
- ```==``` Equal to
- ```!=``` Not equal to

# Logical Combinations:
- ```and``` EG: a==b and b==c
- ```or``` EG: a==b or a==c
- ```not``` EG: not (a == b) # same as !=

- The syntax is simple and yet allows a huge number of combinations. 
For example:
if ```p == q and not p == z and not z == p```
