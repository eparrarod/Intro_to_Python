The keyboard and the screen are the primary mechanism you will use to communicate with the computer.

The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given into the computer console. You may print any type of variable.


The following examples will print the specified message to the screen. 
```
i = 256*256
print("The following is a number: ")
print(i)
