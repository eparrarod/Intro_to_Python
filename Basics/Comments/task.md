# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that describe your code

Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter. Ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other people.

A comment in Python starts with the hash (```#```) character followed by a single space. Comments extend to the end of the physical line. 

You can use Ctrl+/ to comment or uncomment the whole line or a block of code in PyCharm.

### Block Comments
Block comments generally apply to a large section of code that follows them.

Block comments indented to the same level as that code.

### Inline Comments
Use inline comments sparingly. An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement. Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.
