# The US is Weird

The United States measures temperature in Fahrenheit degrees (imperial system), whereas the rest of the world uses  Celsius (metric system). Your friend asked you to develop an app to convert between the two temperature metrics for people from Tennessee wanting to ski in Banff, Whistler, Zermatt, or Verbier. 

The formula to convert from Celsius degrees C to Fahrenheit degrees F is:
F = C*9/5 + 32

Your task is to write a program that will be the basis of this app: 

Your program will:
1. Read a temperature in Celsius 
2. Convert it to Fahrenheit
3. Print the result
