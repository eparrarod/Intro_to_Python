Given two strings, write a method that finds the longest common sub-string. If there is no common subsequence, return "".

A sub-string of a string is a new string generated from the original string .

For example, "ace" is a sub-string of "abcde".
A common sub-string of two strings is a sub-string that is common to both strings.
