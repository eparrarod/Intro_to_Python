# Type Conversion Functions
As we have seen python variables have a type. We can use the function ```type()```o determine the type of a variable.
For example, ```type(x)``` will return the type of variable ```x```. 

Python provides a set of built-in functions that let you convert one data type into another. These functions take in a variable ```x``` and return a new variable representing the converted value in a different type. 

- ```int(x)``` converts ```x``` into an integer. 
- ```float(x)``` converts ```x``` into a floating-point number. 
- ```str(x)``` converts object ```x``` into a string representation.

Task:
- Complete the methods to convert the variables to the appropriate types
