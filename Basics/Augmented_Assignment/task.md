# Augmented Assignment

An augmented assignment is a single statement combining a binary operation and an assignment statement, such as ```+=```, ```-=```, etc.

An augmented assignment expression like ```x += 1``` can be rewritten as ```x = x + 1``` to achieve a similar effect.

# Unary Operators
If you are familiar with other languages such as Java or C++, you may remember the unary operators ++ and -- which increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.

Python does **NOT** have unary increment/decrement operators (++/--)

Task
- Use an augmented assignment to add 5 to number and update the variable.
