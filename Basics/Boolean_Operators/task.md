# Boolean operators
Boolean is a type of value that can take only one of two possible values. It can only be ```True``` or ```False```. 

The most common boolean operators are ```<```, ```>```, ```==```, ```>=```, ```<=```, and ```!=```.

Boolean operators compare the values of two objects. The objects need not have the same type. If both are numbers, they are converted to a common type. 

The equality operator ```==``` compares two variables and checks whether they are equal. variables of different types that are not numbers always compare unequal.
Equal means that they have the same value.

Task
- Check whether the variable two is equal to three.
- Check if the variable is_equal has a deceiving name.
- Check if the variable is_false does indeed contain a lie.


The operators ```is``` and ```is not``` test for object identity: 
- ```x is y``` is ```True``` if and only if x and y are the same object
- ```x is not y``` yields ```True``` if and only if x and y are NOT the same object

## Boolean Operators TLDR
- ```<``` Less than
- ```>``` Greater than
- ```<=``` Less than or equal to
- ```>=``` Greater than or equal to
- ```==``` Equal to
- ```!=``` Not equal to
- ```is``` The two variables reference the same entity NOT only the same value
- ```not``` negation
