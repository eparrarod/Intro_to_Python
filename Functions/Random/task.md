# Random Numbers

Many depend on an element of unpredictability or chance. Those that do not might be
more properly called puzzles. 

Given that computers do calculations, and that calculations should have the same result every time, how does one produce anything that is random using a computer? The answer is partly in how the term random is defined. The discussion involves some mathematics or at least some basic ideas in probability and statistics.


## Python random()
In Python, there is a function we can use to obtain a random number generated by a computer algorithm.
To use it you first need to import the random module
```import random```
The random module provides several functions to obtain random numbers:
- ```random()``` produces a random float number between 0.0 and 1.0
- ```randint(a,b)``` produces a random integer between a and b

Then, you can call the functions like so
- ```random.random()```
- ```random.randint(1,6) # A Dice``` 

Alternatively, you can import the function you want from the random module
Examples:
```
from random import random
x = random()
```

```
from random import randint
x = randint(5,10)
```
Task:
- Generate a number between 1 and 100

Optional Task: Obtain an integer number within a specific range using only random() and NOT randint()
 - Hint: It involves some math

# A Bit of Probability

- If integers in the range 1 through 10 are considered, what is the likelihood (chance,probability) that the number 5 will be selected at random?

  The answer is 1 in 10 or 0.1. This is true each time that question is asked. 

- If the number 5 has just been chosen and another number is to be chosen, what is the chance that it will be a 5? 
  
  Same answer: 1 in 10 or 0.1. 

The  principle is that the next choice does not depend on the previous one; itâ€™s a part of what makes them random.

- What is the likelihood that the number 5 will be selected twice in a row at random?

  The answer is 1 in 100, or 0.01. but why?
   Because to get two in a row, the first one must be a 5 (1 in 10) and the
second one must also be a 5 (also 1 in 10) so the resulting likelihood is 1 in 10*10 or 1 in 100.
