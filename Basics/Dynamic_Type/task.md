# Dynamic Type
Unlike other programming languages like Java, variables in Python use something called ```dynamic typing``` which means you do not need you to specify the type of value they will be allowed to store.

In Java, you need to specify the type for a variable (strongly typed),
```int variable;```

In python, you only need to create the variable, the type of the variable will be detected by Python during the execution of the program
```variable```


Task:
