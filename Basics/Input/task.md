# Input
When humans send information into a computer program, it is generally by entering text.

In the case of sending a value into a program in Python, the word input can be used within a program. 
For example:
```radius = input()```
input will accept a value typed by the user using the keyboard and will return it as a string of characters. This makes sense because the user typed it as a string of characters.

If you are expecting a number, use casting to convert the input text into the appropriate type.
