# Best of N

We will expand the Rock Paper Scissors game by allowing the game to be played several in rounds and let the best of N be the winner.

In particular, 
If the game is played 6 times with the following results:
- computer = rock, player = scissors
- computer = scissors, player = paper
- computer = paper, player = rock
- computer = scissors, player = paper
- computer = rock, player = paper
- computer = scissors, player = rock

The results shows will be:

The computer won: 4 rounds

The user won: 2 rounds

We will use an integer to determine who won the round. In particular,
- 0 = player won the round
- 1 = computer won the round
