# Suite 
Python calls a group of indented statements a suite. You can simply call it a block of code.
As mentioned before when using if statements, the set of lines of code or statements that will be executed if the condition is ```True``` need to be indented.

```
if a < b:
    a = a + 1
    b = b – 1
c = a – b
```

In this case the two statements following the ```:``` are indented by 4 more spaces than the if and the condition
This indentation tells Python that they are both a part of the if statement, and that if the value of a is smaller
than the value of b, then both of those statements will be executed.
