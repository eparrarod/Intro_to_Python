You can put any of the code you have learnt thus far inside of a function as long as the code is properly indented.

## Loops and functions

Any loop can be placed inside of a function. Since the code within a function must be indented, the code inside a loop must be indented to be both inside of the function and inside of the loop's suite.

```
def ckechout():
    counter = 1
    while counter < 5:
        counter += 1
```
