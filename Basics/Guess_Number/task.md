# Guess a Number
On this task, we will write a program to have the user guess a number that the program has chosen?

There are many variations on this simple game. 

In our case, we will do the version in which the number needs to be guessed correctly.
The game work as follows:
- One person (the chooser) has selected a number, an integer, in a specified range. “Pick a
number between one and ten” for instance. 
- The other person (the guesser) must choose a number in that range. If they select the correct number, then the guesser wins.

In our program, the computer will select a random number within a range and will ask the user to guess

Task:
- Complete the program using everything you have learned thus far
- Run the code a couple of times using different numbers
